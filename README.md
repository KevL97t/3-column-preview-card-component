## My process

1.- Checked the styles to be implemented.
2.- Checked the additional styles such as fonts, font sizes and 
calligraphy.
3.- Created semantic html as required.
4.- Added styles to the site.
5.- Created responsive design for other devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Found ways to make it easier to be responsive using flexbox and his properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.main-container{
    flex-direction: row;
}
}
```
### Continued development

Need to keep practicing and focusing on building more complex and elaborated ideas.
